# debianization-files
Scripts and files for packaging debian software using dh-make.

Please note that the debian/changelog file is not automatically updated for each release, nor are the list of dependencies.

If you find anything that could be fixed or changed, please open a pr, I am a beginner to maintaining debian packages so any feedback is welcome!
